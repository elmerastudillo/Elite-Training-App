# SendGrid-Swift

![swift4.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-v4.1-green.svg) ![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/os-macOS-blue.svg) ![iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/os-iOS-blue.svg) ![Linux\*](https://img.shields.io/badge/os-Linux\*-blue.svg)

This library allows you to quickly and easily send emails through SendGrid using Swift.

## Important: Version 1.0.0 Breaking Changes

Versions 1.0.0 and higher have been migrated to Swift 4 and adds Linux support, which contains code-breaking API changes.

**Previous Breaking Changes**

- Versions 0.2.0 and higher uses Swift 3, which introduces breaking changes from previous versions.
- Versions 0.1.0 and higher have been migrated over to use SendGrid's [V3 Mail Send Endpoint](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Mail/index.html), which contains code-breaking changes.

## \*A Note About Linux

While this library does function on Linux via the Swift Package Manager, it relies upon the [open source Foundation library](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation) (specifically `URLSession`).  As it stands, [`URLSession` hasn't been fully implemented yet](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/blob/master/Docs/Status.md). This library uses what has been implemented to make the HTTP requests, but critical implementations such as invalidating the session are unavailable, which could lead to unexpected behaviors such as memory leaks. That being said, Linux supported in this library should be treated as *experimental*.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the SendGrid module to the "dependencies" and "targets" sections of your Package.swift file like so:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyApp",
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/scottkawai/sendgrid-swift.git",
            from: "1.1.0"
        )
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyApp",
            dependencies: ["SendGrid"]
        )
    ]
)
```

**Note!** Make sure you also list "SendGrid" as a dependency in the "targets" section of your manifest.

### With Cocoapods

Add the following to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'SendGrid', :git => 'https://github.com/scottkawai/sendgrid-swift.git'
```

### As A Submodule

Add this repo as a submodule to your project and update:

```shell
cd /path/to/your/project
git submodule add https://github.com/scottkawai/sendgrid-swift.git
```

This will add a `sendgrid-swift` folder to your directory. Next, you need to add all the Swift files under `/sendgrid-swift/Sources/` to your project.

## Usage

### Authorization

The V3 endpoint supports authorization via API keys (preferred) and basic authentication via your SendGrid username and password (*Note:* the Mail Send API only allows API keys). Using the `Session` class, you can configure an instance with your authorization method to be used over and over again to send email requests.

It is also highly recommended that you do not hard-code any credentials in your code. If you're running this on Linux, it's recommended that you use environment variables instead, like so:

```swift
///
/// Assuming you set your SendGrid API key as an environment variable
/// named "SG_API_KEY"...
///
let session = Session()
guard let myApiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["SG_API_KEY"] else { 
    print("Unable to retrieve API key")
    return
}
session.authentication = Authentication.apiKey(myApiKey)

///
/// Alternatively `Session` has a singleton instance that you can 
/// configure once and reuse throughout your code.
///
///     Session.shared.authentication = Authentication.apiKey(myApiKey)
```

### API Calls

All the available API calls are located in their own folders under the `./Sources/SendGrid/API` folder, and each one has its own README explaining how to use it. Below is a list of the currently available API calls:

## Development

If you're developing on macOS, you an generate an Xcode project by running the following:

```shell
cd /path/to/sendgrid-swift
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

This project also contains a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file which runs Ubuntu 16.04 with Swift 4 installed. Running `docker-compose up` will execute the `swift build` command in the Linux container. If you want to run other commands, you can run `docker-compose run --rm app <command>`.

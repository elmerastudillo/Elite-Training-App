    /// block list](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/blocks.html#Delete-blocks-DELETE).

    /// ## Delete All Blocks
    /// 
    /// To delete all blocks, use the request returned from `Block.Delete.all`.  
    /// This request will delete all blocks on your block list.
    /// 
    /// ```swift
    /// do {
    ///     let request = Block.Delete.all
    ///     try Session.shared.send(request: request) { (response) in
    ///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)

    /// }
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Delete Specific Blocks
    /// 
    /// To delete specific entries from your block list, use the `Block.Delete` 
    /// class. You can either specify email addresses (as strings), or you can 
    /// use `Block` instances (useful for if you just retrieved some from the 
    /// `Block.Get` class).
    /// 
    /// ```swift
    /// do {
    ///     let request = Block.Delete(emails: "foo@example.none", "bar@example.none")

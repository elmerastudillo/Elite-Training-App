/// The `Email` class is used to make the Mail Send API call. The class allows
/// you to configure many different aspects of the email.
/// 
/// ## Content
/// 
/// To specify the content of an email, use the `Content` class. In general, an 
/// email will have plain text and/or HTML text content, however you can specify 
/// other types of content, such as an ICS calendar invite. Following RFC 1341, 
/// section 7.2, if either HTML or plain text content are to be sent in your 
/// email: the plain text content needs to be first, followed by the HTML 
/// content, followed by any other content.
/// 
/// ## Personalizations
/// 
/// The new V3 endpoint introduces the idea of "personalizations."  When using 
/// the API, you define a set of global characteristics for the email, and then 
/// also define seperate personalizations, which contain recipient-specific 
/// information for the email. Since personalizations contain the recipients of 
/// the email, each request must contain at least 1 personalization.
/// 
/// ```swift
/// // Send a basic example
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let plainText = Content(contentType: ContentType.plainText, value: "Hello World")
/// let htmlText = Content(contentType: ContentType.htmlText, value: "<h1>Hello World</h1>")
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address(email: "foo@bar.com"),
///     content: [plainText, htmlText],
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email)
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// An `Email` instance can have up to 1000 `Personalization` instances. A 
/// `Personalization` can be thought of an individual email.  It can contain 
/// several `to` addresses, along with `cc` and `bcc` addresses.  Keep in mind 
/// that if you put two addresses in a single `Personalization` instance, each 
/// recipient will be able to see each other's email address.  If you want to 
/// send to several recipients where each recipient only sees their own address, 
/// you'll want to create a seperate `Personalization` instance for each 
/// recipient.
/// 
/// The `Personalization` class also allows personalizing certain email 
/// attributes, including:
/// 
/// - Subject
/// - Headers
/// - Substitution tags
/// - [Custom arguments](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/SMTP_API/unique_arguments.html)
/// - Scheduled sends
/// 
/// If a `Personalization` instance contains an email attribute that is also 
/// defined globally in the request (such as the subject), the `Personalization` 
/// instance's value takes priority.
/// 
/// Here is an advanced example of using personalizations:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// // Send an advanced example
/// let recipients = [
///     Address(email: "jose@example.none", name: "Jose"),
///     Address(email: "isaac@example.none", name: "Isaac"),
///     Address(email: "tim@example.none", name: "Tim")
/// ]
/// let personalizations = recipients.map { (recipient) -> Personalization in
///     let name = recipient.name ?? "there"
///     return Personalization(
///         to: [recipient],
///         cc: nil,
///         bcc: [Address(email: "bcc@example.none")],
///         subject: "Hello \(name)!",
///         headers: ["X-Campaign":"12345"],
///         substitutions: ["%name%":name],
///         customArguments: ["campaign_id":"12345"]
///     )
/// }
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello %name%,\n\nHow are you?\n\nBest,\nSender",
///     html: "<p>Hello %name%,</p><p>How are you?</p><p>Best,<br>Sender</p>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: personalizations,
///     from: Address(email: "sender@example.none"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: nil
/// )
/// email.headers = [
///     "X-Campaign": "12345"
/// ]
/// email.customArguments = [
///     "campaign_id": "12345"
/// ]
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// You'll notice in the example above, the global email defines custom headers 
/// and custom arguments. In addition, each personalization defines some headers 
/// and custom arguments. For the resulting email, the headers and custom 
/// arguments will be merged together. In the event of a conflict, the 
/// personalization's values will be used.
/// 
/// ## Attachments
/// 
/// The `Attachment` class allows you to easily add attachments to an email. All 
/// you need is to convert your desired attachment into `NSData` and initialize 
/// it like so:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello World",
///     html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address(email: "foo@bar.com"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// do {
///     if let path = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "proposal", withExtension: "pdf") {
///         let attachment = Attachment(
///             filename: "proposal.pdf",
///             content: try Data(contentsOf: path),
///             disposition: .attachment,
///             type: .pdf,
///             contentID: nil
///         )
///         email.attachments = [attachment]
///     }
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// You can also use attachments as inline images by setting the `disposition` 
/// property to `.Inline` and setting the `cid` property.  You can then 
/// reference that unique CID in your HTML like so:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello World",
///     html: "<img src=\"cid:main_logo_12345\" /><h1>Hello World</h1>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address(email: "foo@bar.com"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// do {
///     let filename = NSImage.Name("logo.png")
///     if let path = Bundle.main.urlForImageResource(filename) {
///         let attachment = Attachment(
///             filename: "logo.png",
///             content: try Data(contentsOf: path),
///             disposition: .inline,
///             type: .png,
///             contentID: "main_logo_12345"
///         )
///         email.attachments = [attachment]
///     }
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Mail and Tracking Settings
/// 
/// There are various classes available that you can use to modify the 
/// [mail](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/mail.html) and 
/// [tracking](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/tracking.html) 
/// settings for a specific email.
/// 
/// **MAIL SETTINGS**
/// 
/// The following mail setting classes are available:
/// 
/// - `BCCSetting` - This allows you to have a blind carbon copy automatically 
/// sent to the specified email address for every email that is sent.
/// - `BypassListManagement` - Allows you to bypass all unsubscribe groups and 
/// suppressions to ensure that the email is delivered to every single 
/// recipient. This should only be used in emergencies when it is absolutely 
/// necessary that every recipient receives your email. Ex: outage emails, or 
/// forgot password emails.
/// - `Footer` - The default footer that you would like appended to the bottom 
/// of every email.
/// - `SandboxMode` - This allows you to send a test email to ensure that your 
/// request body is valid and formatted correctly. For more information, please 
/// see the [Classroom](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/sandbox_mode.html).
/// - `SpamChecker` -  This allows you to test the content of your email for 
/// spam.
/// 
/// **TRACKING SETTINGS**
/// 
/// The following tracking setting classes are available:
/// 
/// - `ClickTracking` - Allows you to track whether a recipient clicked a link 
/// in your email.
/// - `GoogleAnalytics` - Allows you to enable tracking provided by Google 
/// Analytics.
/// - `OpenTracking` - Allows you to track whether the email was opened or not, 
/// but including a single pixel image in the body of the content. When the 
/// pixel is loaded, we can log that the email was opened.
/// - `SubscriptionTracking` - Allows you to insert a subscription management 
/// link at the bottom of the text and html bodies of your email. If you would 
/// like to specify the location of the link within your email, you may specify 
/// a substitution tag.
/// 
/// **EXAMPLE**
/// 
/// Each setting has its own properties that can be configured, but here's a 
/// basic example:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello World",
///     html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address(email: "foo@bar.com"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// email.mailSettings.footer = Footer(
///     text: "Copyright 2016 MyCompany",
///     html: "<p><small>Copyright 2016 MyCompany</small></p>"
/// )
/// email.trackingSettings.clickTracking = ClickTracking(section: .htmlBody)
/// email.trackingSettings.openTracking = OpenTracking(location: .off)
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Unsubscribe Groups (ASM)
/// 
/// If you use SendGrid's 
/// [unsubscribe groups](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Suppressions/advanced_suppression_manager.html) 
/// feature, you can specify which unsubscribe group to send an email under like 
/// so:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello World",
///     html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address(email: "foo@bar.com"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// /// Assuming your unsubscribe group has an ID of 4815…
/// email.asm = ASM(groupID: 4815)
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// You can also specify which unsubscribe groups should be shown on the 
/// subscription management page for this email:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello World",
///     html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address(email: "foo@bar.com"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// /// Assuming your unsubscribe group has an ID of 4815…
/// email.asm = ASM(groupID: 4815, groupsToDisplay: [16,23,42])
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## IP Pools
/// 
/// If you're on a pro plan or higher, and have set up 
/// [IP Pools](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_pools.html) 
/// on your account, you can specify a specific pool to send an email over like 
/// so:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello World",
///     html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address(email: "foo@bar.com"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// /// Assuming you have an IP pool called "transactional" on your account…
/// email.ipPoolName = "transactional"
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Scheduled Sends
/// 
/// If you don't want the email to be sent right away, but rather at some point 
/// in the future, you can use the `sendAt` property. **NOTE**: You cannot 
/// schedule an email further than 72 hours in the future.  You can also assign 
/// an optional, unique `batchID` to the email so that you can 
/// [cancel via the API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/cancel_schedule_send.html) 
/// in the future if needed.
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello World",
///     html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address("foo@bar.com"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// // Schedule the email for 24 hours from now.
/// email.sendAt = Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 24 * 60 * 60)
/// 
/// // This part is optional, but if you [generated a batch ID](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/cancel_schedule_send.html)
/// // and specify it here, you'll have the ability to cancel this send via the API if needed.
/// email.batchID = "76A8C7A6-B435-47F5-AB13-15F06BA2E3WD"
/// 
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// In the above example, we've set the `sendAt` property on the global email, 
/// which means every personalization will be scheduled for that time.  You can 
/// also set the `sendAt` property on a `Personalization` if you want each one 
/// to be set to a different time, or only have certain ones scheduled:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let recipientInfo: [String:Date?] = [
///     "jose@example.none": Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 4 * 60 * 60),
///     "isaac@example.none": nil,
///     "tim@example.none": Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 12 * 60 * 60)
/// ]
/// let personalizations = recipientInfo.map { (recipient, date) -> Personalization in
///     let personalization = Personalization(recipients: recipient)
///     personalization.sendAt = date
///     return personalization
/// }
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello there,\n\nHow are you?\n\nBest,\nSender",
///     html: "<p>Hello there,</p><p>How are you?</p><p>Best,<br>Sender</p>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: personalizations,
///     from: Address(email: "sender@example.none"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: nil
/// )
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Categories
/// 
/// You can assign categories to an email which will show up in your SendGrid 
/// stats, Email Activity, and event webhook. You can not have more than 10 
/// categories per email.
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello World",
///     html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address(email: "foo@bar.com"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// email.categories = ["Foo", "Bar"]
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Sections
/// 
/// Sections allow you to define large blocks of content that can be inserted 
/// into your emails using substitution tags. An example of this might look like 
/// the following:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let bob = Personalization(recipients: "bob@example.com")
/// bob.substitutions = [
///     ":salutation": ":male",
///     ":name": "Bob",
///     ":event_details": "event2",
///     ":event_date": "Feb 14"
/// ]
/// 
/// let alice = Personalization(recipients: "alice@example.com")
/// alice.substitutions = [
///     ":salutation": ":female",
///     ":name": "Alice",
///     ":event_details": "event1",
///     ":event_date": "Jan 1"
/// ]
/// 
/// let casey = Personalization(recipients: "casey@example.com")
/// casey.substitutions = [
///     ":salutation": ":neutral",
///     ":name": "Casey",
///     ":event_details": "event1",
///     ":event_date": "Aug 11"
/// ]
/// 
/// let personalization = [
///     bob,
///     alice,
///     casey
/// ]
/// let plainText = ":salutation,\n\nPlease join us for the :event_details."
/// let htmlText = "<p>:salutation,</p><p>Please join us for the :event_details.</p>"
/// let content = Content.emailBody(plain: plainText, html: htmlText)
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: personalization,
///     from: Address(email: "from@example.com"),
///     content: content
/// )
/// email.subject = "Hello World"
/// email.sections = [
///     ":male": "Mr. :name",
///     ":female": "Ms. :name",
///     ":neutral": ":name",
///     ":event1": "New User Event on :event_date",
///     ":event2": "Veteran User Appreciation on :event_date"
/// ]
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Template Engine
/// 
/// If you use SendGrid's 
/// [Template Engine](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Transactional_Templates/index.html), 
/// you can specify a template to apply to an email like so:
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let personalization = Personalization(recipients: "test@example.com")
/// let contents = Content.emailBody(
///     plain: "Hello World",
///     html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
/// )
/// let email = Email(
///     personalizations: [personalization],
///     from: Address(email: "foo@bar.com"),
///     content: contents,
///     subject: "Hello World"
/// )
/// /// Assuming you have a template with ID "52523e14-7e47-45ed-ab32-0db344d8cf9z" on your account…
/// email.templateID = "52523e14-7e47-45ed-ab32-0db344d8cf9z"
/// do {
///     try Session.shared.send(request: email) { (response) in
///         print(response?.httpUrlResponse?.statusCode)
///     }
/// } catch {
///     print(error)
